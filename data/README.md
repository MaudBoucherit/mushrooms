# Mushrooms Project - Data
This folder contains the raw datasets of the Mushrooms Project.

The `mushrooms.csv` dataset is from the kaggle's open datasets bank [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification).   
Donated to the UCI Machine Learning repository: 27 April 1987

## Content

This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.
