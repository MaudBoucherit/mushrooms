## Data

Stored [here](data/mushrooms.csv), added on 2017-11-23   

I am using the kaggle's mushrooms dataset (from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)). It contains information about several mushrooms species like their cap's colour, their odor, or if they are poisonous. I want to adjust a decision tree using poisonous or not as my labels, and with the features:   
- cap-shape,  
- cap-color,  
- odor,  
- gill-spacing,  
- gill-size,  
- gill-color,  
- stalk-color,  
- spore-print-color,  
- habitat.
